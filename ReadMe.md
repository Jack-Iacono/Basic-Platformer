## Platformer Tech Demo
First and foremost, thank you for taking the time to view my project, I put a lot of time into it and tried to make the features as fleshed out as possible

This is a basic tech demo of various concepts which I wanted to experiment with within a 2 dimensional platformer base, features include

# Various Powerups
- Bounce Boots
- Stone Shoes
- High Jump
- Triple Jump (there is already a double jump)
- Double Dash (you can already dash once)
- Gun (only on test level 3 as it was never made into a full level)

# 4 Whole Levels (Excluding Test Levels)
- Triple Jump Tutorial
- Double Dash Tutorial
- Boots Tutorial
- Final Challenge

# Controls (I'm sorry for the bad mapping)
- Arrow keys for menu navigation
- Enter to select menu option
- WASD for in game control
- W for jump
- Spacebar for dash when in the air
- Shift to change grenades on select levels (test level 4 works the best)
- V to throw Grenade
